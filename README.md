✈️ AI Virtual Plane Project
An interactive AI-powered virtual plane simulation where users can control and draw flight paths using hand gestures. This project combines computer vision and AI to create an immersive, real-time experience.

🔍 Project Overview
The AI Virtual Plane project allows users to control a virtual plane in real time using hand gestures. It recognizes gestures for actions like moving, drawing paths, and erasing, offering a fun and interactive experience.

Key Features:
* Control the virtual plane using hand gestures.
* Draw shapes like circles and rectangles for.
* Eraser tool to modify paths dynamically.
* Real-time interaction using webcam input.
* Sound effects for actions like takeoff, drawing, and erasing.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
Programming & Libraries:
* Python
* OpenCV (for webcam and image processing)
* MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
* NumPy
* PyGame or OpenCV (for sound effects and visuals)
* TensorFlow / Keras (if AI model used for gesture recognition)
